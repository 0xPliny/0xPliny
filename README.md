# Chase Logan | AI Systems Architect & Knowledge Operating Systems

I design and build **Knowledge Operating Systems** that transform how development teams interact with AI. My work focuses on creating structured, repeatable methodologies that deliver measurable improvements in cost efficiency and development velocity.

Instead of ad-hoc prompting, I build systems that provide **structured context**, **governance**, and **repeatable workflows** — turning AI from a conversational toy into an engineering tool.

### The Pliny Framework

The core of my methodology is the **Pliny Framework**, a set of structured workflows for AI-powered development:

| Methodology | Purpose | Flow |
|-------------|---------|------|
| **R-I-S-E** | Creation | Research → Identify → Synthesize → Execute |
| **C-A-R-E** | Debugging | Context → Analyze → Respond → Evaluate |
| **HARVEST** | Documentation | Capture knowledge and feed it back into the system |

These workflows replace unstructured, conversational AI usage with repeatable, governed processes that compound over time.

### Impact

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Cost Efficiency** | 21x improvement — reduced cost per completed work item from $7.64 to $0.35 |
| **Development Velocity** | 10x increase in output while reducing cost |
| **Knowledge Base Growth** | +396% — grew shared documentation from 50 to 248+ files |

### What I Build

My systems integrate across five layers:

1. **Knowledge Base** — Structured documentation repositories that give AI real context about your codebase
2. **AI Agent Runtime** — Cursor IDE with custom rules, skills, and personas for domain-specific execution
3. **Governance & Standards** — Automated quality gates, coding standards enforcement, and compliance checks
4. **Workflow Orchestration** — R-I-S-E, C-A-R-E, and HARVEST methodologies applied to every task
5. **Continuous Learning** — Output feeds back into the knowledge base, making the system smarter over time
