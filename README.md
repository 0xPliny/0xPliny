# Chase Logan | AI Systems Architect & Industrial Automation Expert

![MHC 2.0 Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xPliny/pliny-framework/main/MHC_2.0_Framework_Diagram.png)

I design and build **Knowledge Operating Systems** that transform how development teams interact with AI. My work focuses on creating structured, repeatable methodologies that deliver measurable improvements in cost efficiency and development velocity. The framework above, MHC 2.0, is a live system that has demonstrated a **21x improvement in cost efficiency** and a **10x increase in development velocity** at Murata Machinery.

My expertise lies in:
- **AI System Architecture:** Designing the full stack, from knowledge base to governance layer.
- **AI Agent & Skill Development:** Building custom AI agents and skills to automate complex tasks.
- **Structured Prompt Engineering:** Creating repeatable, high-quality prompts and workflows.
- **Industrial Automation:** Applying AI to solve real-world problems in complex industrial environments.

I am passionate about building systems that not only solve technical challenges but also empower developers and drive business value. I believe that the future of software development is not just about using AI, but about building systems that use AI effectively.

### 🔧 My Framework: The Pliny Framework

I have open-sourced the core of my methodology in the **[pliny-framework](https://github.com/0xPliny/pliny-framework)**. This repository contains the R-I-S-E, C-A-R-E, and HARVEST workflows that form the foundation of my approach.

### 🚀 My Public Portfolio

- **[pliny-framework](https://github.com/0xPliny/pliny-framework):** The core methodology for AI-powered development.
- **[ai-pliny](https://github.com/0xPliny/ai-pliny):** A portfolio of AI experiments and demonstrations.
- **[pliny-omniverse](https://github.com/0xPliny/pliny-omniverse):** An interactive 3D visualization of my AI portfolio.
- **[ai-documentation-toolkit](https://github.com/0xPliny/ai-documentation-toolkit):** A collection of tools for AI-powered documentation generation.

### 📈 My Impact

- **21x Cost Efficiency:** Reduced the cost per completed Jira item from $7.64 to $0.35.
- **10x Development Velocity:** Increased the number of completed Jira items by 3x while reducing cost.
- **+396% Knowledge Base Growth:** Grew the AuroDev documentation from 50 to 248 files.
